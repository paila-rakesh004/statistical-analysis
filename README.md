# Statistical Analysis with Python: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to performing statistical analysis using Python, focusing on both descriptive and inferential statistics. By leveraging libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `statsmodels`, you will learn how to summarize data, uncover patterns, and make informed predictions based on real-world datasets.

The project includes examples and exercises using datasets such as the built-in **Diabetes** dataset from the `sklearn` library, as well as datasets from **Kaggle** and the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## Sections Overview

### 1. Basic Concepts in Statistics
- **Population vs. Sample**: Understand the distinction between these two key statistical concepts.
- **Need for Sampling**: Explore why sampling is essential in statistical studies.
- **Benefits of Sampling**: Learn about accuracy, cost efficiency, and manageability of sampled data.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- **Mean, Median, Mode**: Measures of central tendency.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Measures of data spread.
- **Range, Percentiles, IQR**: Understand data distribution.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis**: Insights into the shape of data distribution.

### 3. Inferential Statistics
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Making inferences based on sample data.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating population parameters.
- **Regression Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables.
- **ANOVA and Chi-Square Tests**: Comparing group means and testing categorical data.

### 4. Statistical Analysis with Python
#### Libraries Required:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`

#### Getting Started:
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn statsmodels
```

#### Example Code Snippets:
- **Loading Data**:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

# Load the Diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
df = pd.DataFrame(data=diabetes.data, columns=diabetes.feature_names)
df['target'] = diabetes.target
```

- **Descriptive Statistics**:
```python
print("Mean:\n", df.mean())
print("Median:\n", df.median())
print("Mode:\n", df.mode().iloc[0])
print("Standard Deviation:\n", df.std())
```

- **Inferential Statistics (t-test example)**:
```python
from scipy import stats

# Perform one-sample t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(df['bmi'], 0.05)
print(f"T-Statistic: {t_stat}, P-Value: {p_value}")
```

- **Confidence Interval**:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Compute 95% confidence interval for BMI
mean_bmi = np.mean(df['bmi'])
se_bmi = stats.sem(df['bmi'])
confidence_interval = stats.norm.interval(0.95, loc=mean_bmi, scale=se_bmi)
print(f"95% Confidence Interval for BMI: {confidence_interval}")
```

- **Regression Analysis**:
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

X = sm.add_constant(df['bmi'])  # Independent variable
y = df['target']  # Dependent variable

# Fit linear regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

### 5. Exercises
#### Exercise 1: Analyzing a Health-Related Dataset
- Load a health-related dataset from **Kaggle** or the **UCI Repository**.
- Perform descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
- Conduct a hypothesis test and calculate confidence intervals for specific features.

#### Exercise 2: Exploring Regression Analysis
- Perform linear regression on a chosen dataset (e.g., predicting disease progression from BMI).
- Interpret coefficients and evaluate model performance using p-values and R-squared values.

## Datasets

- **Diabetes Dataset** (from `sklearn` library)
- Additional datasets from **Kaggle** and **UCI Machine Learning Repository**

## Conclusion

This repository provides a solid foundation for performing statistical analysis using Python. By following the examples and completing the exercises, you will become proficient in both descriptive and inferential statistics, enabling you to analyze real-world datasets effectively.
